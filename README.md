# Re-former
### Description: A Rails project for building a bare-metal and helper forms. 
### Goal: Building a form from scratch with pure HTML and then implementing helper methods provided by Rails.

### Approach: 

* Utilized Rails 7.1.2
* Created a new rails app using `$ rails <new app-name>`
* Generated a new Github repository and connected the remote repository.
* Modified the README file to include the Odin Project link for future reference.
* Followed the steps outlined in the lesson to build a bare-metric form and a helper form.
* Improved the project's documentation using the markdown format.

### Key Technologies: 
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML/CSS
* Git and Github
* RESTful conventions

### Instructions to Use:

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone git@github.com:your-username/re-former.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder and launch the console: `$ cd re-former && rails console`
3. You can now create a new user and edit the user's details through the Rails console.

Known Bugs:

* None at the moment.

Next Steps:

* Implement user authentication/authorization.
* Enhance the form's validation and error handling.
* Incorporate more Rails helper methods to simplify the form.
